  Each client can be configured for itself. Therefore simply use the service identifier of the desired service, e.g. "icalfeed", and replace "[serviceIdentifier]" with it.
  E.g. the property looks like "com.openexchange.httpclient.icalfeed.readTimeout". For futher details please have a look at [[https://documentation.open-xchange.com/{{version}}/middleware/administration/http_client_configuration.html]] .
