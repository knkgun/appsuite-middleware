      description: |
        Appointments and tasks are available via the CalDAV interface if they fall 
        into a configurable timeframe. This value specifies the start time of this 
        interval, i.e. how  many days in the past should be considered. More formal, 
        this value defines the negative offset in days relative to the current date 
        representing the minimum end time of appointments and tasks to be synchronized.
        A value of "0" disables the limit, which is the default.

      description: |
        Controls whether resources sent by the client that fall out of the configured 
        timerange are rejected by the server or not. If enabled, such PUT requests are 
        answered with HTTP 403 and the "CALDAV:max-date-time" / "min-date-time" 
        preconditions as per RFC 4791. 
        However, since some clients are not really able to cope with these reponses, the 
        check is deactivated by default so that such data sent by the client is still 
        accepted by the server.

        <code>https://dav.open-xchange.com/caldav/[folderId]</code> as the value
        If you are using user-agent sniffing use
        <code>https://[hostname]/caldav/[folderId]</code>
